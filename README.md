# IoTrac
An IoT Data Management SaaS

## Service Overview
### Data Collection and Ingestion
Data is sent to the server from each IoT device using protocols such as MQTT or HTTP. Included in this data may be device-specific information like the device's location, status, or any sensor readings for which the device is equipped (temperature, humidity, air quality, etc.). Data points can be transmitted either in real-time or at regular intervals.
High-speed data ingestion without performance degradation can be handled by Redis. Redis Streams can also be employed as a log structure for storing data prior to its processing.
### Data Processing and Analysis
After ingestion into the system, the data is processed and analyzed. Real-time processing and analysis can be facilitated using Redis modules like RedisTimeSeries for time-series data, or periodic processing can be done by transferring the data from Redis to a more permanent storage solution (such as a relational database or a data lake).
Actions like data clean-up, anomaly detection, machine learning algorithm application for predictions, or data aggregation for further analysis might be involved in data processing.
### Data Storage
Quick retrieval and real-time analytics are enabled when processed data is stored back into Redis. For long-term storage and complex queries, data can be moved from Redis to a traditional database system or a data warehouse.
### Data Visualization and Action
Visualization of processed data is made available through a user-friendly dashboard, enabling users to comprehend the status and trends of their IoT devices. Actions or alerts can be triggered by any anomalies or important insights. For instance, notifications can be sent to the user or technician if an IoT device is found to be malfunctioning.
## User Base and Potential Utility of this Application
### Manufacturers
By this system, monitoring and management of machinery and equipment on the factory floor can be performed by manufacturers. Data analysis allows for predictive maintenance to be conducted.
### Smart Cities
Monitoring of various IoT devices installed around the city can be done by cities. This might include sensors for traffic, weather, air quality, etc.
### Farmers/Agriculture Industry
Soil quality, weather conditions, and livestock tracking can be monitored using an IoT system by farmers.
### Home Automation
Efficient management and automation of devices in a smart home setup can be done by individuals.
### Healthcare Providers
Real-time patient data monitoring can be achieved by sending data from IoT devices in healthcare such as wearable devices or medical equipment in hospitals.
